I am a Ph.D. student in [JSK Robotics Laboratory](http://www.jsk.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/ ) (Prof. Masayuki Inaba and Kei Okada) at The University of Tokyo.

To realize robots that can support people's daily life, I am doing research on life support robots, mainly on recognition, manipulation, planning, and learning for cooking robots.
